## A bit about me

I don't confine myself to a particular lane of development; I just like to build. Whether it's designing a button or coding a payment flow, I'm in my element when working with a blank canvas - playing with pixels and pushing code until things click.

Working freelance for a large part of my career, I’m used to wearing multiple hats. From communicating with clients, designing APIs to building component libraries; I’m a versatile engineer who is able to apply my skill set and experience to multiple roles.

Outside of staring at Figma / VS Code, I mostly enjoy:

- Spending time with my wife, Ellie, and our two year old son
- Plummeting my rank on Rocket League
- Annually logging into World of Warcraft to justify my subscription
- Obsessing over medieval history

<br />

## Why Tailwind Labs?

There’s an intersect between design and code which is hard to get right (there’s a reason templates and component libraries are so popular). Tailwind Labs are unique in that they offer:

- Tools to style (Tailwind CSS)
- Tools to scaffold (Headless UI)
- Tools to build (Tailwind UI & Catalyst)

This combination bridges the gap between code and design and gives developers the ability to build well designed interfaces which are accessible, easy to implement and scalable. It does a lot of the heavy lifting and makes the hard stuff easy.

While happy in my current role, I can't help but feel this opportunity is tailor made for me. I like working in smaller teams, I like the way you communicate and I would be proud to contribute to something that I am passionate about and use every day.

<br />

## Why am I a good fit?

I use Tailwind CSS a lot. I use Headless UI a lot. I use Tailwind UI a lot. I’m keen to translate my day to day exposure of these tools into experiences that help make other users interaction as seamless and effective as possible, while also working to improve the products at their core.

Regularly jumping between design and code, I like to think I have good taste and can operate effectively where the two disciplines meet.

I also value the opportunity to learn. Knowing what you have achieved so far, I'm excited at the prospect of working alongside such a talented team.

<br />

## What could we do together?

I'm hyped about the upcoming projects, especially the command palette and wider expansion of templates and components. Here's some other things I'd be keen on exploring:

### Color generation

When coding around a set of brand guidelines, you're usually working with a set of core
colors but not their full range of shades. Translating this into your Tailwind CSS
config often results in setting a fixed color (`e.g. text-brand-blue`)
or using a <a href="https://uicolors.app/create" target="_blank">
color generator</a>.

I'd like to explore how we could improve on this, such as offering a built in generator or expanded config options.

### Customisable components

Whether it's to allow the user to explore Tailwind CSS's flexibility or to save a few minutes from making changes directly in their editor, some code snippets could benefit from allowing the user to configure it in browser and grab the generated code.

<div className="not-prose mb-6">
	<ComponentExample />
</div>

### Interactive examples

There are some example sections on the Tailwind CSS docs that may benefit from allowing the user to cycle through the property values to quickly compare in order to find what they're looking for. Think of it like going into your web inspector, highlighting an element and cycling through the available CSS style values.

<div className="not-prose mb-6">
	<MixBlendExample />
</div>

Thank you for reading. You can check out my [experience](/tailwind/experience) and [journey](/tailwind/journey) as a developer so far using the tabs above. I'd be thrilled to hear back from you guys and have a chat.

Either way, I'm eager to see what's next for Tailwind.
