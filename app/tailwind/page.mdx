## A bit about me

Ever since my introduction to coding and design, I’ve never liked to confine myself to a particular lane of development; I just like to build. I'm in my element with a blank canvas - using functional design and clean code to develop high quality user interfaces.

Working freelance for a large part of my career, I’m used to wearing multiple hats. From communicating with clients, designing APIs to building component libraries; I’m a versatile engineer who is able to apply my skill set and experience to multiple roles.

Outside of staring at Figma / VSCode, I mostly enjoy:

- Spending time with my wife, Ellie, and our two year old son
- Plummeting my rank on Rocket League
- Annually logging into World of Warcraft to justify my subscription
- Listening and reading about medieval history

## Why Tailwind Labs?

There’s an intersect between design and code which is quite hard to get right (there’s a reason templates and component libraries are so popular). Tailwind Labs are unique in that they offer:

- Tools to style (Tailwind CSS)
- Tools to scaffold (Headless UI)
- Tools to build (Tailwind UI & Catalyst)

This combination bridges the gap between code and design and gives developers the ability to build well designed interfaces which are accessible, easy to implement and scalable. It does a lot of the heavy lifting and makes the hard stuff easy.

While happy in my current role, I can't help but feel this opportunity is something tailor made to my skill set. I like working in smaller teams, I like the way the team communicate and I would be proud to contribute to something that I am passionate about and use day to day.

## Why would I be a good fit?

I use Tailwind CSS a lot. I use Headless UI a lot. I use Tailwind UI a lot. I’m keen to translate my day to day exposure of these tools into experiences that help make other users interaction as seamless and effective as possible, while also working to improve the products at their core.

Regularly jumping between design and code, I like to think I have good taste and can operate effectively where the two disciplines meet.

It’s also not lost on me the value of the second hand knowledge. With what has been achieved so far, I know working with you guys would be an opportunity to learn and improve.

## What could we do together?

I'm excited about the upcoming projects, especially the command palette and extending the range of templates and components. Here's some other things I'd been keen on exploring:

<br />

### Color generation

When coding around a set of brand guidelines, you often get a set of core
colours but not their full range of shades. Translating this into your Tailwind CSS
config often results in setting a fixed color (`e.g. text-brand-blue`)
or using a <a href="https://uicolors.app/create" target="_blank">
color generator</a>.

I'd like to explore how we could improve on this, such as offering a built in generator or expanded config options.

<br />

### Customisable components

Whether it's to allow the user to explore Tailwind CSS's flexibility or to save a few minutes from making changes directly in their editor, some code snippets could benefit from allowing the user to configure it in browser and grab the generated code.

<div className="not-prose mb-6">
	<ComponentExample />
</div>

<br />

### Dynamic examples

There are some example sections on the Tailwind CSS docs that could benefit from allowing the user to cycle through the property values to quickly compare and find what they're looking for. Think of it like going into your web inspector, highlighting an element and cycling through the available CSS style values.

<div className="not-prose mb-6">
	<MixBlendExample />
</div>
